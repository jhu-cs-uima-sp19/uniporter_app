README: As a part of Sprint 1 in terms of back end, we first created a Postgres Database to store the following: User accounts, User past preference inputs for their rides, User past share rides. We integrated Postgres with Django and Django Rest Framework to create API-endpoints. We also set up serializers, view-sets, and migration models for the following, and use the Django ORM to map these nested data points to Postgres RDBMS.:Users, Preferences, Tags, Rides and set up authentication and correct association between them. Our servers were linked to the app backend with API’s (RetrofitClientRides, RetrofitClientSharerides, RetrofitClientUser) 

In terms of front end, we created the main landing page, the register page, the log-in page, and pages to add a new ride. We have made it so that once you log-in once, you are always logged into the app. Once you are on the main landing page, you can open click on the hamburger to open the nav drawer. From there we have included three options: “New Ride”, “Pending Rides”, and “Log out”. You can add a new ride by clicking on “New Ride”. This will take you to the first page in a sequence of pages (you can see what part of the step you are on based on the circles at the bottom). There is the flight information page where you can put in your airline (from a spinner with all airlines at BWI) and the flight number and we will make an API call to get the date information and time of the flight. If we can't find it or you would rather prefer, you can enter the flight time manually (this will be done in the second sprint since we were not able to get the right format). The second page ask where you live on campus. This spinner drops down to show a list of all the common residences on campus. We took out the option for them to manually enter an address since it would involve a lot of working converting the address to GPS coordinates we use to calculate the optimal meeting location. The third page takes you to where you can customize how much you are willing to walk to meet with your group. The fourth page is for how much luggage you are bringing. Since we cannot account for every type of large luggage we made a spinner that will enable the user to give us an approximate size of the special item based on a scale we created and explained in a short paragraph. The last page is how early the user is willing to leave (in hours) before their flight. We added an x button in the corner of every page to exit the add a ride process. In the second sprint we want to add a pop-up that tells the user that they will lose the data they have entered up to this point. We have a final confirmation page after which their request is submitted and all the information is sent to the database backend.
